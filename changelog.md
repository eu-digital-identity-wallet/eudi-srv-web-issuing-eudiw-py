# Changelog

## [0.3.0]

### Added:
-  A new mandatory argument, "device_publickey", has been added. This new attribute is the wallet instance public key.
-  Added a tutorial on how to use Pytest, which can be found in the tests folder, "Pytest_Tutorial.md".


### Changed

-  Modifications to the /get_pid and /pid routes: when the "country" parameter is empty, the user is redirected to the 
    /pid route to choose the corresponding country. In the /pid route, when a card is selected, the user is redirected 
    back to /getpid, now with the desired country information.
    
### Fixed	
-  Correction in the encoding process where the data was encoded twice in base64. Rectified to just base64 encoding.


## [0.4.0]

### Added:

-  Added tutorial on using the Robot framework, found in the tests folder under the name, "robot_tutorial.md".
	
-  Added functionality for issuing mDL requests, both in CBOR and SD-JWT format. To use the "/mdl" and "/getmdl" 
    routes, the operation and arguments required are the same as for the PID.
	
- Added metadata to the PID ("issuance_date", "expiry_date", "issuing_authority" and "issuing_country").
	
- Added the "un_distinguishing_sign" attribute to the mDL.
